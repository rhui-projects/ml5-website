Many students in England do not start KS3 Computer Science with any understanding of Computer Science nor computer programming. The difficulties with teaching Python programming to year 7 pupils seems to be following strict Python syntax. Did you forget any indentations, colons, or brackets? Well, too bad! Your program will not work!

To overcome the complex Python syntax, we cann use block code to help KS3 pupils with coding. This seemed to be engage many more pupils. There are also features in the online code editor which enable more advanced pupils to program in Javascript and Python if they wish to further extend their skillset.
